*In recent days I was looking for a way to steal data from a computer using just a USB Drive, many of these tutorials were flawed or indiscreet, so I tried to adapt so that automatically when you open the .bat file it downloads the folders to it.
I put 3 .exe files in case you can be less discreet when Hijacking.*

**BrowsingHistoryView** - Download the browsing history from months ago (normal version (this version was also tested on a 64-bit computer and worked normally, but if it doesn't work on the victim's computer, try using the 64-bit version).<br />
**BrowsingHistoryView64x** – Download the browsing history from months ago (64-bit version).<br />
**WebBrowserPassViewer** - Downloads logins and passwords (which the person has entered to “always remember”).

_(At the top of the 2 programs will have a save option, click on it and choose your USB card folder to save all infos.)_

### 1 - Step
- Download the 6 files I put in this directory (**file.bat**, **invisible.vbs**, **launch.bat**, **WebBrowserPassViewer.exe**, **BrowsingHistoryView.exe** and **BrowsingHistoryView64x.exe**) and place them in the same folder, (the files .exe does not need to be in the same folder).
### 2 - Step
- In the file.bat file, edit the directories and place the directory corresponding to the folder that the USB Drive will receive the files.
### 3 - Step
- Now put the usb card and open the **launch.bat** file and it will start to copy all those folders from the computer you mentioned in **file.bat**.

<br />

**TURNING INTO AUTORUN, TO STEAL AUTOMATICALLY WHEN PLACED:**
<br />
To make the .bat file run automatically you need to transform it into .exe, we will use the program "Bat To Exe" that I left in the repository (or if you want to access the download on the official website, I left it in the "main credit"). after you have transformed launch.bat into launch.exe, we will install another program that will make the .exe file run automatically when the usb card is placed which is called "Sam Logic USB Auto Run Creator" so after installing, select launch.exe to automatically open and select the location on the card from a few files it will create to make the usb card usable automatically

<br />

*If you want to change the name of these files to hide yourself, you will have to open all the documents and leave the name of it the same as what you changed.*

*Before performing this process on someone's computer, test this method on your computer until you actually learn how it works, otherwise you run the risk of not working or in the worst case leaving a trace that you were copying data from the victim's computer to their computer.*


*BrowsingHistoryView, BrowsingHistoryView 64x and WebBrowserPassView is just a optional feature, you don't need this to steal files*
